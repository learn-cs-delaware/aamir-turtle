# here is an example of a for loop

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in numbers:
  print(i)

print(list(range(10)))
print(list(range(5,10)))

# we can also use "range" to get a list of numbers
numbers = range(1,6) # equals 1 through 5
for i in numbers:
  print(i)

# Exercise: have the loop print numbers 1-30
